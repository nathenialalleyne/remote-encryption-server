### Overview

The **Remote Encryption Server** is designed to provide encryption and decryption capabilties for sensitive data during transit. It is designed to provide short-lived encryption keys, stored securely on a remote server, to ensure security at all times. This service can be ran and deployed locally, allowing users full control over encryption operations and key management, without relying on external infrastructure.
